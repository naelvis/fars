README.md
================

The main purpose of this file is to redirect the user of this (totally
legitimate) package to its vignette, accessible by typing:

Don’t forget to load the package beforehand, or it will not work. We
also wanted to show off the cool badge on top, since it took quite long
to pass all the travis test… they even consider warning as errors\! Have
fun with this package, and don’t forget to read the vignette.
